* Installation

  Building tolua on a Unix system should be very easy:

	1. Edit "config" to suit your platform, if at all necessary.
	2. Then, type "make".

  See below for instructions for Windows and Macintosh.

* What you get

  If "make" succeeds, you get:
	* an executable to generate binding code in ./bin;
	* the C library to be linked in your application in ./lib;
	* the include file needed to compile your application in ./include.
  These are the only directories you need for development, besides Lua.

  There is testing codes in src/tests and, if you are lucky, there is a manual page 
		in html in ./doc. You don't need these directories for development.

* Installation on Windows

  The instructions for building tolua on a Mac or Windows machine depend on
  the particular compiler you are using.
  The simplest way is to create a folder with all .c and .h files, and
  then create a project for the executable and the library, as follows:

  tolua.exe: all *.c *.h in src/bin.
  tolua.lib: all *.c *.h in src/lib.

		Under directory ./win32, there is a project sample for Visual C++ 6.
